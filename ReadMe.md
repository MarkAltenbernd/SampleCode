## Code Samples ##
This repository includes complete code samples from a number of different projects I have worked on over the past few years. At initialization of the repository in June 2017, there are 6 separate projects:

- Lobby Wall of Monitors
- Odometer
- Streaming Video Price Estimator
- Visited Sites List
- Word Indexer, implemented in Flex and ActionScript
- Word Indexer, implemented in HTML and JavaScript

Each project has its own ReadMe file.
