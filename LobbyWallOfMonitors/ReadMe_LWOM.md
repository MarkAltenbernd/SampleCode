# Lobby Wall of Monitors #
A series of custom Flex components for real-time data visualizations. The components are displayed in the lobby of the client's corporate headquarters building in an array of 10 high-definition monitors. Five of those displays are active here, and you can see the gauges in action by clicking on the active panels. (Use your browser's Back button to return to the 10-panel display.) Links at the bottom of the page lead to additional information about the components.
